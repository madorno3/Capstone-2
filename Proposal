Capstone 2 Proposal

NYC Public Restrooms App- updates about public restroom locations, their conditions, if theyâ€™re open- 

Focus- I think this app will be evenly focused on front and back end

Type Will this be a website? A mobile app?- I think it will eventually be a mobile app as that is where its application would make most sense.
For now I think it will be a web app, though i am open to that changing depending on how involved it will be.

Goal What goal will your project be designed to achieve?- The goal is to life easier for New Yorkers by providing them with a tool they can use when they need
to use a public restroom. It will tell them the bathroom locations, how many stalls, if its accessible, and more.

Users What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is
the demographic of your users?- I can't see teenagers or children using this, so I would say 18+. People that are on the go and it would definitely be useful for tourists.

Data What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on
collecting your data?- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Public-Restrooms/i7jb-7jku/about_data NYC has an api that provides data on bathroom locatations,
accessibility, opration hours, cleanliness grades. All sorts of info.

Features-
-List of top 5 cleanest bathrooms (could even break it down by borough)
-Allow users to save bathrooms they go to frequently
-Ability to review bathrooms
